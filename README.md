# PortSwigger Web Security Academy Solutions

This repository contains my personal write-ups and solutions for the labs on the [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security).

The goal of this project is to document my learning journey in web application security. Instead of just saving the final answer, I focus on explaining the **"why"** and **"how"** behind each vulnerability.

## What You Will Find Here
For each lab, I provide a breakdown that includes:

* **The Objective:** What the goal of the lab was.
* **The Analysis:** How I found the vulnerability (looking at code, testing inputs, etc.).
* **The Solution:** The step-by-step process to exploit the bug.
* **The Payloads:** The specific scripts or code used to solve the lab.

## Why This Matters
Documenting these labs helps me:
1.  Reinforce my understanding of vulnerability classes like XSS, SQL Injection, and more.
2.  Improve my technical writing and reporting skills.
3.  Build a reference guide for future security assessments.

## Disclaimer
These solutions are for **educational purposes only**. They are created to demonstrate understanding of web security concepts using the authorized testing environments provided by PortSwigger.
